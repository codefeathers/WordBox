### WordBoxedâ€”A truly modern development environment for WordPress

WordBoxed is a truly modern WordPress site development (and deployment) environment.

Bring the power of Node.JS to your WordPress environment!

### Running the server

1. Download php zip from https://php.net and place the extracted files under `/php`.
2. Download WordPress from https://wordpress.org and place the extracted files under `/wp`.
3. [Optional] If you're on Linux, edit the config file to point to your `php-cgi` bin file.
4. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (Express).
5. Run `node .` to start the server.

### Versioning

Due to certain reasons, our versioning bumps from `v.0.1.0` to `v.1.1.0`. Due to this, the project should be considered unstable until `v.2.0.0` which will be the first public release version.
